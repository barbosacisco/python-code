# python-programs

### What is the purpose of this repository?

This is my portifolio as a Python Junior Developer. Here you may find programs I wrote while learning Python. 

My main goals are:

~~~
  * Create readable code;
  * Follow PEP8 Guidelines for clean code;
  * Push code related to simple programs I wrote myself and that I learned from books and courses. 
  * Push my own projects to show my progress as a Python Developer.
