# python-programs

### What is the purpose of this repository?

This is my portfolio as a Python Junior Developer. Here you may find programs I wrote while learning Python. 

### My main goals are:


  * Create readable code;
  
  * Follow PEP8 Guidelines for clean code;
  
  * Push code related to simple programs I wrote myself and that I learned from books and courses. 
  
  * Push my own projects to show my progress as a Python Developer.

#### How can you help?

You can help me out by creating issues with improvements I can do to my programs and scripts. This will be very much appreciated. 

#### How can I help you?

Maybe you are a beginner and this repository can have content for you to look at it and learn from. If you are an advanced programmer, maybe you can find something useful anyway or you can help improving it by giving some tips and/or correcting code.
