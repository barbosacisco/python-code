# Code for Problem Solving


### What is the purpose of this repository?

The purpose is to show, through short and simple programs, that I possess knowledge of the foundation concepts of programming, for instance:

- Variables
- Lists
- Loops
- Operators
- If Statements
- Functions
- Automation Scripts

### My main goals are:

  * To create readable code;
  
  * To follow Python guidelines for clean code;
  
  * To show strong coding concepts through very simple code;
    

### Why programming concepts through simple programs?

Because I am learning and because the central point is to solve problems, not being the programming language the main focus but foundation concepts that can be abstracted to other languages to solve problems and create software and solutions to its problems.
    
#### How can you help?

You can help me out by creating issues with improvements I can do to my programs and scripts. This will be very much appreciated. 

#### How can I help you?

Maybe you are a beginner and this repository can contain content for you to look at it and learn from. If you are an advanced programmer, maybe you can find something useful or you can help improve it by giving some tips and/or correcting code.
