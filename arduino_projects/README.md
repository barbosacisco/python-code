### Arduino Projects

#### This code was taken from: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel and https://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Controlled-Positional-RGB-LED-Christmas-Tr/

I just made a fix and used to have my Christmas Tree controlled with Arduino. 

I will later organize and modify the code.
